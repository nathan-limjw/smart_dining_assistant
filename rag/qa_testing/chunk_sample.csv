I have ordered from here several times for both delivery and pickup. Last week, we ordered with a 35 minute estimate, and after 1 hour and 20 minutes called the restaurant to ask about our pizza. We were hung up on twice, and finally put on hold for 5 minutes only to be told that our order hadn't left the building. The person on the phone was incredibly short and rude about it, and hung up on me when I told her to cancel the order.

Then, I received a call from ""customer service"" to confirm my cancellation. When I tried to talk about the issue, I was rudely cut off and the caller rattled off the ""discount-time policy"" to me. Essentially, I was told to sit and wait for my pizza (it was 11pm at this time) and whenever it came I would get a $ discount based on the amount of time after the window. So, essentially, wait more than two hours for pizza, receive no call that it will be late, and screw off. 

This really wasn't even about the discount at this point, it was ultimately about how rude and unpleasant everyone was being.

I emailed the company the next day. Received a can email ""will contact you in 3 business days."" Guess what didn't happen? Emailed back, received a canned ""escalation"" email for another three business days. In 19 minutes that window is up, haha.

Being a Saturday & home with two kids, I said, ""heck it, let's go!""
Upon arriving, the parking lot was almost empty. I was like ""yuusss"", it's not packed.
I bought myself & kids the wristbands that allowed us to enjoy certain things unlimited times for 3 hours. The price for those? $105.
Come to find out, my almost 4 year old was unable to ride the go karts & my 8 year old was unable to drive one, unless he was riding with me. We were unable to enjoy that, seeing how I couldn't just leave my 4 year old on the sideline, unattended.
The mini golf was pretty cool, but unattended. I had a teen getting in the way while I was trying to play with my kids.
The bumper cars was another thing we were unable to do. Seeing how they had like 4 available & the others were broken down on the track. Even if they were all up & running, I didn't see a two seater one, for those of us who have small kiddos who need to ride with us. 
Half of the arcade games were not functioning.
As for the ""health measurements"" they claim to practice, WHERE?
I was there for 3 hours, & not once did I see someone sanitize something.
The people working there look like high schoolers who hate their job. No excitement from employees what so ever, then again, with a place like this, I'd be pretty dang depressed too & would only be there to get a paycheck.

That having been said this is a place to avoid. it has now made news for an employee beating a customer unconscious with the TV news showing him brutally kicking the man when he's down. 

and even that I can't site the other employees for it, though let's be honest that alone is enough to avoid this place. where the real problem comes in is how the staff responded. Local TV news crews were just told to get out and it was 'private property' when they went to the employee's last known address a foul mouthed woman, IN McDONALD's UNIFORM greeted them (ha!) at the door and said, with several expletives, if they told you to get out at the McDonald's why do you think we're going to talk to you. It was clear the McDonald's had called the house to warn them. So in uniform and swearing and clearly the go to is COVER UP. 

At that point you can hold them accountable. this isn't a case of ""I can't believe I work in a place where someone did this"" so much as it is complicit in the act by not being up front and swearing while in uniform without a disclaimer or any statement, from management shows how this place is run.

She wanted to fight over straws. I did not receive any with my order and once I requested them she threw a temper tantrum ran inside the building and refused to bring me any.

I didn't even know they had a breakfast menu.

Ordered the #4  with a coffee.

Drive they only had two cars in front of me.

I must agree the potatoes were really good.
Hot and crispy on the outside, and a lot of them. 

Chicken sandwich was perfect size for me. 

I was able to order cream for the coffee and he had added a few sugar packets!

Nice sized coffee and less mess when the cream is already added.!

But the kids who used to work here actually had work ethic and integrity and were working here as a first job to pay for parts on their first truck or a new gun.  Now that the democrats moved into the area, the kids who work here have a sense of entitlement and have extremely poor work ethic. Its not really Taco Bell's fault, it is the fault of the parents who raise teenagers with a lack of morals. In fact so many times this location has been closed because people dont show uo for their shifts and they dont have the staffing to be open. And these kids want 15 dollars per hour? LOL!

If youre not a lazy democrat and still raise your kids to have work ethic and morals, tell them to go work at this Taco Bell. They could be what saves it.",2019-03-09 19:59:18,"{""BikeParking"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsPriceRange2"": ""1"", ""RestaurantsAttire"": ""'casual'"", ""RestaurantsGoodForGroups"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsTakeOut"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsReservations"": ""False"", ""GoodForKids"": ""True"", ""BusinessAcceptsCreditCards"": ""True"", ""GoodForMeal"": ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", ""HasTV"": ""True"", ""BusinessParking"": ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", ""RestaurantsTableService"": ""False"", ""RestaurantsDelivery"": ""True"", ""Ambience"": ""{'touristy': None, 'hipster': None, 'romantic': None, 'divey': False, 'intimate': None, 'trendy': None, 'upscale': None, 'classy': None, 'casual': None}"", ""DriveThru"": ""True"", ""OutdoorSeating"": ""None""}"

My family and I decided to eat there on December 13th around 7:00 p.m. The restaurant wasn't busy at all.  My first red flag was with the cashier that took our order.  She gave the impression that she didn't like being there.  She entered our entire order on the screen by hitting the screen really hard with her knuckles.  We sat down and waited for our order.  I noticed that the restaurant was really dirty.  There was a milk shake that spilled all over one of the tables, trash all on the floors, etc.  There were two families that came in after we did.  They got their food and we're still waiting.  I finally went up to the counter after 20 minutes had passed.  I asked one of 14 kids (we counted) behind the counter if they had an idea of how much longer it would be on our food.  The cashier yelled out that she was waiting on the chicken tenders.  As I'm going back to my table I noticed that the family that came in after we did had a little girl that was eating - yes, chicken tenders!  After we had waited a total of 25 minutes they finally called out that our food was ready.  I'm assuming by the way the kids behind the counter were treating me that they didn't appreciate me asking how much longer it would take to get our food.  These were some of the loudest, most disrespectful teenagers I had ever seen in a customer service atmosphere.  It was so obvious the way they were treating us that the manager followed us outside to ask if everything was okay.  Needless to say, this was my first and last trip there.  The manager should be embarrassed to allow his staff to 1) stand around horsing around 2) be disrespectful to their customers.  We go to the Steak and Shake in Murfreesboro frequently.  They have very nice employees there that treat the customers really well.  We've never had a bad experience there.

By the time I got done eating it, about 4:59 after I brought it through the front door of my house, I looked like Ne-Yo after a lusty makeout session with Russell Simmons. The late, great Pimp C would have been disgusted. Pause.

I ended up at Pizza Hut because I figured I'd have pizza, even though I just had pizza the other day (#firstworldproblems), it was getting dangerously close to Miller Time, and I wasn't emotionally equipped to try anything new, like one of these suspect places Yelp recommends that's not a chain: they could be great, or they could be one of these mom and pop joints where the pop is his own brother. I wasn't in an adventurous mood.

The good thing about gorging yourself on pizza here in end times is that you can get a pizza from pretty much anywhere for $10. Pizza Hut dropped the prices of its large pizza to $10 a couple of years ago, and everyone else followed suit, and it's been that way ever since. One time Pizza Hut try to ratchet it up to $11, or $12, depending on what you got on it, and that lasted for all of about two weeks. They must have damn near gone out of business.

I don't even sweat trying to find out what the specials are anymore. If I called one of these pizza places and they quoted me a price of more than $10, I'd just laugh in their faces and go somewhere else. Even for Meat Lovers. I think most places still do have that $28 Supreme Pizza listed on their menu, but that's just in case Kanye West calls. What does he care? He's got money to blow. His cocaine comes in a tiny glass bottle (as opposed to baggies).

Speaking of ballin' so hard, the tendency is to want to get everything you possibly can as a topping, since it's free anyway. I'm sure someone has already tried to just run down the entire list of available toppings. It's the new spending four hours at Endless Shrimp. If you're so inclined, it might even be worth trying to have them throw in something that doesn't even go on pizza, like a two liter of Coke. You know, put the entire system on trial!

I just went with pepperoni, sausage and onion, because I find that piling too many toppings on a pizza throws off the delicate balance. A true fatass would rather just eat more than one pizza. If I had it to do over again, I might just go with sausage and onion. Or sausage, onion and some other meat. Because for whatever reason, the sausage at Pizza Hut is delicious by any objective standard (they could serve it at Pi), but the pepperoni is shitty even by elementary school lunch standards.

Suddenly I'm craving a tiny carton of milk.

The pepperoni may have contributed some to the grease factor, because pepperoni pizza regardless of where you get it has that unappetizing and yet delicious layer of orange grease on top of it, but pizza from Pizza Hut also has a shedload of grease in the crust. That's how it got all over my hands. It's not like I was touching the top of it. I get a little bit messy when I'm especially enthusiastic about eating, but it's not like I turn into the developmentally disabled. #noshots

If we've learned anything at all today, it's that pizza from a national chain isn't any good, but Pizza Hut is probably the best of them all, because it's almost certainly the least healthy, and the less healthy something is the better it tastes, as a rule.",2011-12-09 23:45:44,"{""NoiseLevel"": ""u'average'"", ""RestaurantsTakeOut"": ""True"", ""GoodForKids"": ""True"", ""BusinessAcceptsCreditCards"": ""True"", ""Caters"": ""False"", ""RestaurantsGoodForGroups"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsReservations"": ""False"", ""RestaurantsDelivery"": ""True"", ""OutdoorSeating"": ""False"", ""RestaurantsPriceRange2"": ""1""}"

Burned out on turkey subs on honey oat, I suggested BK, because I had just seen an ad for $1.29 Whopper Jrs. We sat in the drive-thru line for around 5 minutes & didn't move, not even an inch. I (the girl on fire - - for a flame grilled burger) convinced my friends to go inside. Maybe the drive thru person was new, it had to be better inside, right?

When we got inside, there were about 10 people in line, 2 workers were taking orders, and, yeah, the line was moving, barely. Or it was until one of the 2 register workers walked away.  That's when I noticed a bunch of customers over by the drink station. They had ordered and were patiently waiting for their ""fast food"". One must have dared to ask a worker how much longer because the worker said loudly and with some attitude: ""Four Minutes"".

Finally, I got to order my $1.29 Whopper. I also ordered a small diet coke. The cashier gseemed shocked as she loudly asked me ""SMALL?"" I thought maybe I'm the only one left who doesn't desire extra large everything with extra mayo like the man in front of us got. After paying and while waiting a LONG time for our order, I realized my small drink set me back $1.79 plus tax. Then I saw on the ""value"" part of the menu that they offer a ""value"" sized drink for $1.00. Not sure if it's a little smaller or bigger than ""small"" but no way the ""small"" is worth 79 cents more. Really, I hope BK enjoys the extra 79 cents they got from me as much as I now cherish being a former customer.

One of the buns is halfway off of my McChicken, and that and the McGriddle are just about touching, so strike 2 = carelessness.

I ordered online, and 15 minutes later, went to pick up my food, because they don't even have ""a time"" you can select on the website to pick up your food. As I approached the location, there were 5 cars in front of me, so I got in line, but called the store to let them know that I was there. The manager answered, and I told her I had an online order, I was outside behind 5 cars, and asked it I pulled along side of the restaurant, if they could bring it out to me, as it was already paid for. She told me, ""Nope, we can't do that...it wouldn't be fair for us to take your order before everyone else in the drive-thru"". I told her again, it was a mobile order, I already placed it 15 minutes earlier, it was already paid for, and if they could bring it out to the car. She again, said ""NO, you can either wait in line or you can come inside""! When I got to the window, I told the person that I had a online order, already paid for and was there to pick it up. The ""Assistant Mgr."" heard the anger in my voice and walked over when I asked to speak to someone in charge. Before I could say anything, she said, ""Why didn't you tell us you were outside""? I told her, I called and spoke to the Mgr. and was told I had to stay in line or come in the store. She kept interrupting me as I was talking and kept saying...""Wait, Wait, Wait, give me a second"" as she was trying to find my order. I asked her to get a Manager, so the Manager walked over, and I told her the same thing...why order online if it's going to take 15 minutes to sit in line with everyone else to get your food? She said you have the option to come in or to wait in line. She could not even answer the questions. They make you drive up if your order is delayed, so WHY CAN'T CUSTOMERS DRIVE UP TO THE SAME AREA TO WAIT ON THE FOOD TO BE WALKED OUT 10 STEPS TO THE WAITING CAR????
She then said, next time, hopefully we can bring it to you, and I said there will be NO NEXT TIME!!! Blows my mind how a two Managers could not even take control of a situation to walk outside to deliver a pre-paid, online order, instead of having to make a customer wait 15 minutes for the order that was placed 15 minutes prior!

Ferandanez he said that Dylan will not bothering me anymore. HE will be spoken too. Well that was good for at least 2 more times. When I went in there he did not give me a hard time over the Senior Rate. The following third time I went in there he started again with saying to me I am Entitled The Entitled people think who the F they are.  I reported him again to Mr. Feranandez who is the owner of this Franchise. I can not understand why a 27 yr old young man who looks like a teenager would be so terrible towards any customer. When he landed with me, He dealth with the wrong person!! 

Dylan recently wrote me a nasty email Well, I told him in response that he did not know what working hard meant. Making, preparing coffee and taking change is according to him ""busting your ass"" is hard work, then he never really worked on the outside world of really busting your behind.

WHEN he can open up his own store and work 18 hours a day making peanuts then let him come to me where as once owned a store and worked my behind off for less than he will ever make in his lifetime.

He is a youngman who feels that Life and Jobs owe it to him. No one owes you nothing.   I am glad that now he has quit... the other gals said he was a constant complainer, even the young gal who used to work there is also gone, she was a smoker, I can not recall her name, she was nice to me, everyone was nice to me except for this young man Dylan, who now lives in AZ... I hope that he prospers in catching a lot of fish in the fishing boats as he said to me the day before he left Einsteins. He said That everyone laughed at me. Good you have had a good laugh that I made a fool out of the person who beguilded others intergrity..

I felt that after the first 3 incidents with the 10 % that was supposed to be given to seniors was the right to get it, if you all do not want us to have it say it. No one says we got to get it I got it all from AARP who says that most resturants gives you discounts..  Then the 4th time incident happened again. I got fed up the manager about  this and He the big guy there did nothing about it and said he will talk to his young man, he did not, when I came in again and got my med coffee he was there and tried to push me around again. I got so fed up and called coporate and spoke to Mr. Ferandanz about this again. This time he said if it happens again he is fired.

Well I was glad he did not get fired he left on his own.. I guess some people need to work with the public its a hard choice to work with the public but you must to learn to respect the Customers First they pay you... you want tips which I think stinks. I buy coffee not to support your behind... let your parents do this, I raised 4 kids on this.. they never once disrespected anyone in the public working class.. and as for Us who are Entitled to this...

Like any owl, it's all about the wings, and like any owl, your eyes will pop out. Because like any sexist establishment, Hooters only hires ridiculously good looking women, usually with massive natural breasts or preferably fake ones. They all wear low cut tops to show off said assets, and tiny little spandex booty shorts that make them basically look like Playboy Bunnies mark II, or strippers, both of which look fantastic and are awesome, but are also completely derogatory towards women and set us back about half a century with regards to equal rights.

I came here against my will. It's true. My last will and testament explicitly states: ""Do not drag my corpse to Hooters."" Now you know. The people that brought me here (Jacob and his friend that does not want to be named), who live in TN, will give it a 6 out of 5 every time for the drinks, the wings, and the girls. One of them also claims they have the best burgers in America. I could not disagree more - the burgers are boring and bland. The wings are good, not great. The girls are spectacular... Jacob was too busy staring at the meat. On the burger, I mean. Typical Jacob though. I think he had the best case of beer goggles (for burgers) in America. 

My opinion of the food was very different from my friends. The wings, I liked. I've been to maybe 10 Hooters in my life and the wings are always pretty good, and don't taste microwaved. However, I got to try a bite of the burger, and it was horribly overcooked. The only saving grace of my visit here other than the nice wings, was our server. She was so lovely and adorable. But the Hooters girls almost always are. However, the bill was insane. And I think generally you tip Hooters waitresses twice as much as you'd usually tip, because they're wearing all that stuff (or that lack of stuff) for you, so it ends up costing way more than you'd expect. Drinks aren't cheap either.

So, given that it is a corporate chain, it has to score 1, 2 or 3. Given that it has amazing beautiful women who are so nice, it scores 3. But given that it is so sexist and slightly overpriced, Hooters is back down to a 2.

I was friends with several Hooters girls in college. I found out that working there is sort of like being a Cheerleader. You can consider it along similar lines, because the employees do. I have to say this particular Hooters has some really amazing women. And like every other Hooters it has good wings, so it's worth a visit. Except that it is an evil chain that is taking over food and putting all the families out of business.

Which means it scores a lowly 2 and you should steer well clear. But if any of the girls from this location are interested, I'm not doing anyone, I mean, thing, next Tuesday night.",2012-07-04 05:13:10,"{""BusinessAcceptsCreditCards"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsPriceRange2"": ""2"", ""RestaurantsGoodForGroups"": ""True"", ""OutdoorSeating"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsReservations"": ""False"", ""HasTV"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsAttire"": ""'casual'"", ""BikeParking"": ""False"", ""Ambience"": ""{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}"", ""NoiseLevel"": ""'average'"", ""Caters"": ""True"", ""BestNights"": ""{'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}"", ""WiFi"": ""'no'"", ""GoodForKids"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsTakeOut"": ""True"", ""BusinessParking"": ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", ""RestaurantsDelivery"": ""True"", ""GoodForMeal"": ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", ""HappyHour"": ""True"", ""Music"": ""{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}"", ""Alcohol"": ""u'full_bar'""}"

It was about 1 PM and we had thought about going to 55 South (would that we had), but opted for Steak 'n' Shake as it was more convenient, or so we thought.

We waited for about ten minutes to be seated while servers slunk around avoiding eye contact and chit-chatting in the area where they pick up food. Finally we saw a tall young man begin to clear tables and folks were seated. Just enough tables were cleared to allow the backlog to be seated.

That same man was our server and he did a fairly adequate job of getting our drinks and taking our orders. Our food finally came and DG's steakburger with bacon was cold as were the fries on the plate. I had the footlong hot dog which was OK. We were never checked on till we were just about to leave when our server asked if I wanted more sweet tea and if I wanted it in a go-cup. The tea was good so I did, No question to see if DG wanted more Coca-Cola.

It took several minutes for a sullen someone to come to the cash register where customers waited patiently to pay for their meals. As we stood there we realized that our feet were sticking to the tile floor; it was dirty and our soles crackled as we lifted them. Hot water and a good scrub would be its only salvation.

Each of us has eaten in many Steak 'n' Shakes through the years and enjoyed burgers, milkshakes, and chili (I even have the recipe for that  tasty dish), but will never eat at this one again.

Friendliness and knowledge of the menu. 1 star.  As I m mentioned above about Covid this restaurant had only the bar area open.
The whole other side of the restaurant was closed.  :-(  The bar area had tables open........BUT, the were full of dirty dishes and glasses.  And the seats at the bar as well.
The Host was running around trying to clean tables and greet people at the same time.  I seen 1 bartender and Maybe 2 servers in the bar area.  I guess 1 cook as well.  Because it took a little while to get our order out but it also was a good crowd of people around 8:00 PM.

Came in at like 5:45, it was fairly quiet. No long line like last time. Downside was that either they just didn't prep anything or I came right after a huge rush, as they were missing two of the five items I wanted (Broccoli Beef and Mixed Veggies). Given this particular location, I would consider both possibilities equally likely. Because there was no one behind me, I opted to wait. 

In the four minutes it took for them to get a fresh batch of veggies and broccoli beef, they forgot every single request I made for my order. They packed up my order to-go (I told them I was dining in), and they put the broccoli beef into a separate container (I told them they could just pile it into the box). They were also about to walk away until I flagged them down for a pair of chopsticks. This immediately became problematic as the broccoli beef was set upside down in the bag, causing the gravy to leak out onto everything. Again, I ate this in, so it was about six paces to the table to unpack the contents of the bag. There was little to no possibility of the contents jostling sufficiently to create the spillage.

I will reiterate my points from my first review. The food is fine. It's super cheap Chinese fare made with expediency in mind. You can create a pretty healthy yet flavorful plate for a reasonable price. It's this particular location that's an issue as apparently they managed to hire the least competent folks in Tucson. I've had no issues with the location in Park Place Mall, which is my other primary location, but I go to this store only because it's on the way home from work when I'm at my hungriest.",2017-02-14 20:37:16,"{""RestaurantsTakeOut"": ""True"", ""Ambience"": ""{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}"", ""OutdoorSeating"": ""True"", ""BikeParking"": ""True"", ""WiFi"": ""u'no'"", ""BusinessParking"": ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", ""GoodForKids"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsTableService"": ""False"", ""RestaurantsPriceRange2"": ""1"", ""GoodForMeal"": ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", ""BusinessAcceptsCreditCards"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsAttire"": ""u'casual'"", ""NoiseLevel"": ""u'average'"", ""RestaurantsReservations"": ""False"", ""RestaurantsGoodForGroups"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsDelivery"": ""True"", ""Caters"": ""True"", ""DriveThru"": ""True"", ""Alcohol"": ""u'none'"", ""HasTV"": ""True""}"

The cook is looking around for someone, even some of the younger staff are starting to freak out, and yet nothing is moving. Finally, the cook just about flips and runs back to find the manager. She comes out, and hurriedly starts checking people out while flagging down someone to seat people. She takes our order quickly, and disappears. This is the last we see her.

He is a great sales associate some may say and I would agree to a certain extent since I found his car knowledge to lack proficiency. In other words, he may know how to sale a car perhaps but can only sales talk you into purchasing one with very basic information about the car, which may portray him as a knowledgeable sales man. Quick tip: Ask for all the details up front with Micheal Castro (from my experience). Do not work out a deal before he shows you the AMVIC and made you aware of all the car conditions. That way, the deal may be reasoned efficiently. On the other hand, Genevieve's patience amazed me. Kudos to her. 
P.S. My experience may differentiate from some others and this is not to say that the salesman is a bad one. I am simply telling the truth. At the end of the day, he made the mistake and I still had to pay the extra $2250, which was not the deal we originally worked out. He did not advocate for me, regarding this extra amount I had to pay. That is what I find shameful.",2015-05-10 18:44:33,null

Experience ever. I frequent the Sonic at broadway and Harrison in Tucson, AZ as it is really close to my home. Who doesn't love a Route 44 on a hot day. Today, after a few long and trying day ( I work I  healthcare, running a medical office, and found out that one of my favorite patient had passed away from the Corona virus) my two girls and I stopped at sonic to get three drinks and three ice creams to enjoy after dinner and hopefully bring a little joy after a really rough and trying day. I arrived at approximately 6:00pm, pulled into stall #3 and ordered our items. I paid with credit card at the stall. I watch as the car hops ran around delivery food, drinks and ice creams to the car near by. At 6:20pm, I press the red button again and asked if we had been forgotten, as we were waiting, and had now seen cars that arrived after us get their orders. Kevin answered the button, asked me what stall we were in, and then said, we are making your blasts, they will be right out. No apology for the delay. We continued to wait. At 6:30pm, ten minutes later still nothing and the car that had pulled up right next to us, got their items, which included ice cream and drinks. So I pressed the button again. This time a female answered, at this point I have been waiting for 30 minutes and am not very happy, as I have Chinese take-out which is now cold because we have been waiting for so long. She tells me that they has issues with the ice Cream machine. I asked for a manager to come out to my car. I also explained that if there was an issue with the ice cream machine, I should have been told. And she stayed that she was very sorry, the order was on them and it would be right out. Another 10 minutes went buy, and another customers order was brought out. I left. Let me be clear, this is not the first time I have waiting for 30-40 minutes for an order at this sonic. The last time this happened, I emailed corporate without ever recieving a response.
I don't except anything. To come from this either. But I want you to know thst because of this, a family that loved Sonic, frequented several
Location in town, will no longer be patrons of any of your locations. 

I called the store to talk to the manager. Kevin answered the phone. I said I would like to talk to the manager. He stated he was the manager. I asked for the name of the general store manager and he said it was him. I said well I want to make sure I am refunded. He started to talk over me every time I tried to talk she kept trying to tell me the order was ready and coming out. I was trying to tell him that I had left and he kept talking over me. Unfortunately, I got angered by us disrespect, especially because I find out the I had already talked to the and her before, and he had not apologized for the issues the first time. I did begin to tell because he kept rudely talking over me. He was snarky and had a bad attitude, and the saying goes, treat other they way you wish to be treated, well Kevin was being rude, ungrateful and unapologetic for this absolutely in acceptable issues happening at his restaurant. Now let me be clear, I am an office manager, I understand how trying it can be and attempted to keep my cool as much as possible. And note that my husband is the general manager of a local restaurant in town and I understand how it is. I don't know if Kevin was having a bad day himself, but unfortunately, he needs to know that as a manager, he needs to handle business appropriately, regardless of his personal issues. I have to everyday. I will let all my friends know about this issue. I hope the Kevin will be made aware of this issue, although I doubt that he will care as he didn't seem to tonight either. I just want to through one last thing put there, Kevin needs to be grateful that he had a restaurant to go to and a job right now. He should be grateful for every customer coming to his store to support and keep them open in the current time.

I got the $6.99 1/2 chicken meal which came with two sides and a roll.  I chose black beans and white rice for my two sides. The grilled chicken was so good...The skin was crispy and the inside was moist and flavorful.  It had a wonderful salty charred flavor!  The sides were prepared well and hot and fresh.  Ask for their mustard curry sauce...it's creamy and divine for dipping the grilled chicken into.  I poured a bunch over my rice....it's so darn good.  

For my boy I got the $4.99 kid's grilled breast strips meal with came with one side, a roll, a drink, and a guava bar.  For his side I chose the corn which was a bit dried out but he's only 2 and could care less.  It was a lot of food for the price!  The guava bar....oh my goodness that guava bar...I've been dreaming about that guava bar all day.  Imagine tart and sweet guava paste sandwiched between two moist pieces of delicious cake....incredible!

Carne asada burrito was tasty, flavorful, and the meat was juicy - not dry here. Savory with the filling and burrito held together well. I also received red and green salsa which complimented well. The red salsa has enough zing that the heat builds! Thought that it would be a little bigger size given that it was $10. Would rate 4.5/5

The corn tortillas for the tacos were well made and with two of them the juices didn't rip the tortilla easily. Solid serving of meat per taco given price.
-Al pastor taco was my favorite of the 4 tacos I ordered. Highly recommend - Rate 5/5
-Carne asada was so dry in the taco, it was average when doused in salsa. Rate 2.5/5
-One Cabeza taco was super tender and good, second taco had some rubbery texture meat pieces unable to chew. Ideally should should be a 4/5 but inconsistent meat texture.

She didnt seem like she wanted to wait on us or give us time to look over their menu - she also never asked us if we had any questions.

The waitress tells me my passport is expired, which is impossible because I just returned from South America 2 months prior. I tell her she's looking at it wrong and she tells me that she's not but that she will get her manager. Then she throws my boyfriends ID at him on the table. After sitting there for 5 minutes, no manager comes over so we leave. Before walking out of the door I asked the hostess to please get her manager. She goes to get her manager and our waitress walks over to me as were standing in front of the door to tell me that she can't serve me alcohol with an expired passport. She clearly never consulted her manager. So, I get out my passport AGAIN to show her the date she was referring to was the date of issue. The date of expiration is underneath it. She didn't want to hear it so she walked away from me before I could show her. Being very rude. The manager comes over and I tell him the whole story, he apologizes.

I enjoyed my cold beverage and relaxing time.  I ordered and paid via my phone's camera scanning the bar code on the mini instructions placed on each table.  My server was prompt and efficient.  The pint cost $10.95.  Like I said, not cheap, but that's airports for you.

Not just stained but actual filth that you can scrape  with your spoon.  I found that rather revolting and mentioned it.  The restaurant just said it is an issue with the new bowls.  I understand that they are difficult to clean but they clear can be cleaned with a little effort.  Anyway, if dirty dishes gross you out, this restaurant is not for you.

That being said, the pho was pretty good though the noodles are mushy.  The broth was good, price reasonable-ish, meat portion above average (except very stingy with tendon).  This is my second time eating at this chain with mushy noodles so might not be a one off issue.  The price is a bit cheaper than some others but they charge for tea so I would say comparable.   If you don't like tea, this is a good deal.  Plus they have a nice combo: soup, green onion cake and a pop for $15.

Restaurant has a nice feel inside but booths are run down with worn and dirty benches.

Damn you could have done that in the first place. Not to mention she must have complained about us to the manager cause I could see both of them whispering and looking back at us...not like I give a damn. 

Did I forget to mention that the waitress never came back to check on us after she brought out our food; she only came back when it looked like we were done with our food and it was time to pay.

I looked up this location and saw they were open until 1:00, so I thought it would be perfect to run to for a quick pizza and drink. When I arrived, an hour before close, the manager was shutting down all the VLT machines and leaning chairs against them, indicating the area was closed down for the night. Usually while I wait for my food I'll throw a few dollars in the machine, but it looked like thar wouldn't be the case. The bartender came from the back and asked for my order. I asked if there was a drink special - and was promptly told no. This seemed odd, as most BPs have something every night of the week, but I assumed being so close to the mall, maybe they didn't run specials. Either way I ordered my drink and my pizza. The bartender then went about her closing duties (again - still an hour before closing time) putting things away. The manager passed by me several times back and forth from the VLTs and never once made eye contact or acknowledged my presence (I was alone at the bar and there was two other tables of three in the lounge). The whole experience was definitely unwelcoming. I quickly ate my pizza when it arrived, and the bartender did ask if it was good after a few bites. Other than that, I settled up and headed out. I probably would have stayed for another drink or two, but it really felt like that wasn't what the staff wanted.

By far the worst pizza I've had. Thin crust was not crunchy, olives were junk and salad was $6 for bad strands of lettuce and minimal cheese which looked horribly powdered. It came in a prepacked divider. Rip off. Not worth more than a dollar. 

Their knots were ok, and extremely unhealthy, but rest was crap.

I normally don't order from them or anyone else but good pizza like Grimaldi's, BJs or Mellow Mushroom but I hadn't gone grocery shopping and normally stock up on organic pizza from Publix or whole foods which btw is cheaper and tastier. But, this was the only place opened late. 

I never want dominoes again. It's just a reminder that corporate chains need to fall and get out the way. I rather pay for quality. Not preservatives and poison.

Neither entree was exciting. Last Caribbean food I had was off the food trucks near 30th (a few years ago). Then, I was less hungry but the food tasted better, which says something. Usually Caribbean food knocks my socks off and makes me swoon. This food was merely ""tasty"".

The sides, which for me are usually the highlight of Caribbean food, were real disappointments. The rice & beans were dry, and the cabbage was boring; the yams were two sweet without enough spice. The plantains were so-so, not better than I could make if handed a plantain and a pot to cook it in.

Dined here two weeks ago when we decided to take my mom to Reno on a day trip. Café Central is located in the Silver Legacy at THE ROW. It was our first time dining here. It wasn't our first choice of place to eat but there was no wait in line so we went for it and we were seated immediately. Spacing between tables were good and complied with social distancing during Covid times. Staff wore masks.

We were actually seated in a booth and we were immediately tended to for our drink orders. Our waitress shortly came after to get our food orders. Mom and I decided to share a Chicken Alfredo meal. Husband ordered the Joe's Special (breakfast meal). Our food came in good time and the presentation was nice. 

Not the best Alfredo pasta I've tasted. The Chicken Alfredo was bland and the sauce was too runny. The two slices of garlic bread were placed on top of the sauce so half of the breads were soggy. Mom and I didn't finish it... it took the three of us to finish the plate. My hubby did not eat the hash brown that came with his meal... it was too oily. We enjoyed our glasses of Coke and refreshing lemonade, though.

We had a good waitress. She was attentive and friendly. It was unfortunate that the food was just mediocre. Maybe will try something else from the menu next time.

We waited to be seated for while, which was fine. Honestly the shortest wait, given everywhere else was over an hour. The wait was short for a reason... the locals know better than to eat there. The food was awful. We paid 60 dollars for food that seemed to be microwaved. 
But this wasn't even the the thing that turned us away... Our waiter was a tall slim man, whose name I can't recall. He was crying out of frustration from the amount of work he had earlier that morning. At first we were understanding and continued to be kind with the intention of tipping large. And then.... he started cussing out loud, very loudly.. at his co workers, and just in general with the intention of all of the customers hearing. He was throwing stuff, punched the bar, yelling and I even heard him at one point make a waitress feel bad for not sharing her tip from her table. He's not quite on purpose. 
He had tables waiting over an hour on food on the outside patio who wound up leaving due to his attitude and lack of service. He had 3 tables including ours at this time. Abigail had the rest and was killing it, she was great. We overheard the table next to us thank her for her great service compared to our waiters. 
We went to the manager and she acted like it was not a big deal. She just apologized and said ""he has only been here for 3 days and he's overwhelmed ""...
I get being overwhelmed, but the attitude he had and his actions were unacceptable. 
The poor younger guy waiting tables told my spouse ""I have to deal with this everyday"". 
I feel so bad for his co workers. 
I will never eat at this place again and I suggest you don't either unless you like garbage food, poor management and bad attitudes.
As far as covid guidelines go, they have none. No one wore a mask, not even employees. Our waiter was wiping his running nose with the back of his hand and brought us our food with those same disgusting hands. 
Our table was not clean when we were sat down. 
The experience was just terrible all together. 
Go somewhere else, it's worth the wait. 

But if you choose to go anyway, ask for Abigail and to be as far away as possible from that man we had.",2021-06-01 12:54:26,"{""RestaurantsTakeOut"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsPriceRange2"": ""2"", ""BusinessAcceptsCreditCards"": ""True"", ""WiFi"": ""u'no'"", ""RestaurantsAttire"": ""'casual'"", ""GoodForKids"": ""True"", ""Alcohol"": ""u'full_bar'"", ""HasTV"": ""True"", ""Caters"": ""True"", ""BusinessParking"": ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", ""RestaurantsDelivery"": ""False"", ""NoiseLevel"": ""u'average'"", ""BusinessAcceptsBitcoin"": ""False"", ""RestaurantsReservations"": ""True"", ""GoodForMeal"": ""{'dessert': None, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", ""BikeParking"": ""False"", ""Ambience"": ""{'touristy': None, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': True}"", ""OutdoorSeating"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsGoodForGroups"": ""True""}"

Once seated, we were sat three feet away from the band, which was extremely loud and unenjoyable, so we had asked if we could move and we waited another 20 minutes for another table. While waiting, hostesses were talking about us complaining that we wanted to move when our reservation was for the dining room, not outside directly next to the band. Finally, we sat 40 minutes past our scheduled reservation and had the pleasure of being sat with our server, Brian. Brian failed to 1) pick up the check on the table from the previous people 2) deliver my coke before my appetizers 3) stick his hand in my drink and touch my straw and 4) forgot to ring in both of our entrees in which we sat and waited 90 minutes for. For the record, my boyfriends cheese steak was burnt and my salad had approximately four leafs of lettuce on it. On top of that, we barely got any refills and he was extremely hard to locate, not when he ran the card though of course.

After my original review I heard from Tom, the owner, a few days later.   He informed me of some shift adjustments and in house training and asked that we try again with the provided gift card.  We did tonight and are glad we did.  The food looks great and it arrived in 25 minutes when they gave an estimate of 45 to an hour.  The star rating will definitely go up in the future if this continues.  Tasty food!


What in the world is going on with the Park Center location?  This evening was our third time ordering delivery from them in the past few months and it will be the last.  We placed our order at 4pm, were told it could be up to an hour and we were fine with that.  The turkey club is worth waiting for when done right. 

Well, it's now 6pm and our driver just arrived.  So a 2 hour wait instead of 1.  Okay, I'm upset but not overly so.  Then I see our food.  What a joke.  Compare my two turkey clubs to the picture on the menu.  Where is the lettuce, onion,  tomato and sauce?  Oh, and the pasta, cold.

Naturally we called to complain.  The manager on duty, Nicole, said she can send replacement sandwiches out.  Not really an option in my opinion since based on delivery times I'd be eating at 8.  She then said she would send a gift card for the cost of two turkey clubs.  Neat, so in the future I can go through this again.  

Bottom line,  if the wait is long, make it worth waiting for.  Don't deliver a sandwich missing half its components.   Don't put pasta in a container an hour and a half before delivering it.  Seems like common sense to me.

Maybe I wouldn't be so upset but as I mentioned in the beginning,  this is the third time recently and every delivery has had mistakes.  The wrong pasta the first time.   And a wedge salad that was just lettuce and bacon, no dressing,  onions,  etc the second time. Just a wilted wedge of lettuce and a few bits of bacon.  It made me wish I had a rabbit to feed it to.  

Oh well, we're done.  Ownership really needs to take a close look at this location, it's falling apart.  Anyone want the gift card, if and when I receive it?

I was not pleased with this location. I've now been in Arizona for a year and this was my first visit. Craving a little of the soup, and salad, my husband and I decided to pop in for a Wednesday lunch. I can honestly say, I didn't care for anything from the service to the food quality here today. 
I give 2 stars because 1. The place was clean, and updated decor made it feel nicer than other Olive Gardens! And 2.its Olive Garden and the prices were what was expected. 
The bad-well, to start our Order was taken by our server, Tyler, who was probably not best suited for front of the house work. He wasn't friendly, or happy to be there, and I heard an adjacent table say ""ouch, he doesn't like his job!"" And I agree. No smile no nothing. My husband ordered spaghetti, I had soup and salad, and we shared the breadsticks.   Soup and salad came out quick-breadsticks were stale as if they had been sitting for while. Meanwhile, we began eating, all salad and soup gone-hubbys spaghetti was not out yet. We waited at the table with no food-and no server in sight. Long long long wait, we finally see Tyler and ask for refills on all and spaghetti. A little annoyed sigh, and he went and got all. 
We didn't see Tyler again until he was flagged down by another table.

The one major draw for PJ Wheilans is that they have a great beer selection.  It's almost as good as Blue Dog Pub's beer selection, but still nowhere near something like Monk's Café (in Center City) or Craft Ale House (in Limerick).  It's good enough though that when a happy hour (or trivia or something else) is setup here, I'm usually up for going (unlike Bones Grille).  The food is okay, nothing special, just the standard pub fare.  I haven't had any complaints about it, but I also can't think of any compliments after several visits.

The service is not bad, not the most attentive, but again, no major complaints.  My one major complaint about PJW is that it can get insanely busy for some happy hour periods (especially on Fridays).  Like busy enough that it becomes difficult to hear your group.

I only go to Rosalita's because some of my friends truly do like it and I must admit, it has a decent happy hour. Speaking of happy hour, I would like to add something that annoyed me when I was there last night. It's not a huge deal-it's just the principle of the thing. So I was there with friends for drinks and wells are $3 during HH. I ordered a cranberry vodka and when I got the bill it was $3 for the well and an additional $.50 for the cranberry juice. I just thought it was petty of Rosalita's. Like do you really need to charge that extra $.50? I understand that premium mixers are typically more, but cranberry juice?

Then I moved away to north Florida where the best Mexican food you're gonna get is at home and you get excited about a Chipotle opening up! 

After four years of being away, I finally came back to Tucson! First on the list- La Parilla, of course! I was so excited to go back. We had a party of 13, nothing too crazy, but it took them over 30 minutes to sit us on a slow Tuesday night around 7:30. Then our server seemed so overwhelmed! He took our drink orders (nervously) and went away for about 20 minutes. This place hosted more than 60 of us before! What's going on? My mom saw a server she has known for years and waived her down. She asked about our drinks and just then the guy comes to give us our drinks. I don't know where he was this whole time, but the ice in my margarita was so melted it was almost gone and made the drink taste watery. He brought the kids cup without a lid! The waiter clearly had issues, he disappeared again for a good 20 minutes without even taking our food order. So my moms waitress friend comes by again and ends up taking up our table! What in the world is going on here? Anyway, she was much nicer and attentive. Service was A+ after she took over, she brought out a fresh margarita, a lid for the kids cup, but then......

Our food arrived! My long awaited (4 years) delicious, life long favorite food! And my heart broke. It was so sadly bad! Everything has changed! The fajitas were burned! The chicken melt was on a soggy tortilla, the beans were bland, and worst of all, the rice was completely different!!!! They had this delicious, lightly seasoned yellow rice for as long as I've known of this place and all the sudden it's mushy orange rice? Not even good for Spanish rice! I think Taco Bell has better Spanish rice and I am NOT kidding. It was mush. The yellow rice was their signature to me! No one else had it! How disappointing.

We were super excited about stop number 1 for the hot and spicy burger here at Good Times Saloon in Dupo. Upon entering we noticed the facility is split into two sections, a bar and a restaurant. We moseyed on over to the restaurabring side and took a seat. We waited about 10 minutes before someone came to take our order (Keep in mind we were the only couple of the establishment). We ordered the six dollar burger, an order of onion rings, and an order of toasted raviolis. After about 20 minutes of waiting the server came back to let us know that they forgot to put the order in and we weren't terribly concerned about it until the food arrived. The description of this burger is supposed to be a thick patty, battered and deep-fried jalapenos, a runny egg, and a Chipotle aioli with melted pepper jack cheese. What we got was a very thin frozen patty, a perfectly cooked egg, jalapenos fresh out of the jar and no other sauces or condiments on a store-bought bun. As you can tell from the photo, this is not the same animal as what's advertised for this establishment. After bringing it up to the server, she brought us a small thing of battered and fried jalapenos( which were delicious), still no aioli and still an inedible Burger. 

The highlight of this sandwich was the perfectly cooked egg, which is pretty impressive this day in age. Outside of that, we did not eat more than 2 bites of this sandwich and it was highly disappointing. On a positive note, the onion rings and toasted ravioli (straight from the hill) were exceptional.

I went there with my friend for lunch around 1:00 pm on Saturday and ordered Dim Sum. They have several food wagons for dumplings, meet, vegetables, desserts, and so on, and you can take food on plates from each wagon that you like. Therefore, you cannot eat varieties of food if you get too much food from the first wagon. Please be careful !! :D

Unfortunately, we went there around 1:00 pm, there are less kinds of food rest than usual, and food was getting a little cold. I think that you had better go there earlier.

The cost depends on sizes of plates, and the sizes are obscure and not clear, so I recommend you to confirm which size the plate is before you take food from wagons.

It is a beautiful location so we decide to support a local business for Thanksgiving. We are a family of two so we always eat out for holiday meals. I booked the reservation weeks before the holiday and arrived 10
minutes before our reservation. The meal itself was a prix fixed meal at $35 per person. Not a huge price but expensive enough to expect decent service. As soon
as we checked in, we were told there was not a 2 person table available so they could set us at the end of large families table that had two open chairs. WHAT???? I don't want to have dinner with my extended family much less a strange family. They didn't look thrilled either. When I refused that arrangement, they offered to pull the small table away from the larger party. Basically, the table is now two feet from the other party and half way into the check in area. The only other option offered was to have dinner in the lounge which was full and extremely loud due to live music. We finally got the manager involved and he found a table outside on the patio and set up a heater to keep off the chill. We order our food. The soup ( lobster bisque) tasted fantastic unfortunately neither of us got even a pea sized piece of lobster. I am willing to forget this because it is hotel dinner not 5 star. Once the food comes, the waitress who hasn't been back since dropping off the soups was smart enough to bring drink
Refills. We got one turkey and one salmon. The turkey was okay some pieces were rubbery but it had a tasty gravy. The mashed potatoes were dried out but with some added butter they were decent. The salmon was way too salty and mediocre at best. 
I am telling myself at this point nothing is perfect but for an $85 meal for two I am not real happy. Then disaster strikes!!! I look down and see something on the side of my glass. On further inspection, I realize it is dried food stuck to the inside of my glass. And it has friends!!! A smear of food dried all the way down the glass and another clump around the bottom the size of a Lima bean. Not a little speck but a significant piece of food stuck on the inside of my glass. After waiting 5 minutes to get the waitress back over, she tries to tell me it is a lemon seed. When I put the glass in front of her face, she said ""eww that is gross"" ""sorry about that, do want another drink"".  Yes, oh course I want another drink. I am trying not to think about how the food got in the glass so I don't throw up the mediocre dinner I am paying $85. She did bring another drink in a clean glass. No further apology or acknowledgment of the incident. I expected at least an apology from the manager. We had to
Put in our dessert order three times because the waiter forgot the order and we asked for coffee. It was good coffee but the carafe was filthy on the outside. Coffee stains and crud in the cracks on the outside of the carafe. Even greasy spoon dinners wipe down to carafes before serving you coffee. Overall, it was more like truck stop  service than elegant hotel service. The food was just mediocre. I wouldn't come back at $40 per person.

I know it has under gone some changes over the past few years and had a reputation in the area for being pricey. My friend and I were seated quickly and the male waiter was impressively attentive. A few years back I had a waitress here who was more interested in flirting with a customer than tending her tables. From the signs on the highway one gets the idea that the new owner must be trying something new (Organic eggs, certified Angus beef). The menu seemed even more progressive (No trans fats, locally grown produce, locally produced wines, and even locally raised pasture fed beef.)
  I went for the pasture fed burger with the asiago cheese and bacon on top with the hand cut steak fries on the side. My friend went for the open faced turkey sandwich with homemade cranberry sauce. Again the service was exceptional. The food arrived hot with restaurant presentation and not just lumped on the plate. One might think we were at some fancy place and not just the corner diner. What a difference! I could actually taste the burger. It was charred just enough on the outside and pink and dripping with flavor inside.
  I'll have to come back again and try some of these other special locally grown dishes. My only complaint was the coffee wasn't drinkable. I'll have to check back to see if this is normal for this local land mark. Comparing prices to some other diners Vincentown is a little more money.

Two of three in our party had dined here before, but I was a first timer... and after our meal, I can safely say that none of us will be rushing back.

Sure, the restaurant offers a fun atmosphere with plenty of seating both inside and out; it has a scenic view of the Delaware Canal; and it's located in the fun area of Lambertville.  It's BYOB and has a diverse selection of menu items from veggies, salads, soups, oysters, steaks, seafood and more.  

Unfortunately, the service we experienced was horrendous.  We arrived promptly for our 7:30 reservation and were seated right away, but weren't greeted by a server for a good ten minutes.  Once we were greeted, it took another 30+ minutes to place our food order, and then we waited more than an hour and fifteen minutes before our entrees arrived.

That being said, we did have oysters (a couple of different kinds) that were awesome.  We attempted to order a salad but were told they were out of the salad we wanted....  bummer.  We also shared a side of cauliflower pure, a side of asparagus, and the scallop entree.  All were OK - nothing to write home about.

We would have liked to wash dinner down with water in addition to our wine, but we had to ask several times before getting that... 

The manager was more apologetic to us than our waiter was, and the table next to us made a point to lean over to share their disappointment with the service as well.

To be honest I was not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised at this little gem. The parking and valet were very nice. The front desk loved our dog and set us up in our room. We take the elevator to the second floor and navigate the maze and find that room and walk in. I am telling you it was all good.  The brick walls and the decor all went together and we were instantly at ease and felt at home, more importantly the dog was loving all the attention she got from the staff and was not freaking out on this first road trip.

We head out to the town and are not able to get 20 feet without someone stopping to pet the dog and ask a ton of questions. Love New Orleans!!!

And yes we felt very safe walking everywhere. Finding grass for the dog was challenging but there is a park behind the hotel within walking distance that worked out great. Again we had no issues at night or any time of the day.

Anyway, we wake up the next morning to hit the road and go downstairs to pack up thinking we will grab something to eat on the way but then notice the breakfast spread on the way out. To pass that bad boy up would be a horrible mistake. So we alter the plan and take a table with the dog. I swear we get one of everything, it all looked great and the again the staff is awesome. 

So yes, if your looking for a great place to stay that has a great location that is walking distance to all the fun then check this place out. If your looking for a great friendly place that will love your pet and not give you any crap like other places, then this is the place, again they could not have been nicer.",2016-11-28 14:41:42,"{""OutdoorSeating"": ""False"", ""GoodForKids"": ""False"", ""NoiseLevel"": ""u'average'"", ""BusinessAcceptsCreditCards"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsGoodForGroups"": ""False"", ""RestaurantsTakeOut"": ""False"", ""Caters"": ""False"", ""WiFi"": ""'free'"", ""RestaurantsPriceRange2"": ""2""}"

First thing, we get there, we are seated, and served glasses of water.  Cool! It's a buffet, so basically the water is your cue to help yourself.  I will admit that, being a vegetarian, and mom is on and off, I was pleased to see that they had a good variety of veg/non veg food.

I first set down a few small bowls of chutneys at our table to have with our meal.  Not even 10 minutes later, we just get done making our plates of food, and find that not only has the staff removed our entire place setting, but there is another group sitting there! Mind you, the restaurant still had several available seats.  So naturally, we made somewhat of a (DF?) fuss.  The staff basically stood staring at us dumbfound until we just sat at another table.  The remainder of the time was just awkward; probably contributing to us not enjoying our food. I actually wanted to leave at that point but mom wanted to stay.

When I rank Indian food, I'm basically comparing it to that of my family's.   The pani puri was a delight to see since my regular Indian buffet never has them.  The garlic naan bread and dal were pretty good, and so was the gulab jamun.  But the rice was severely under-cooked and crunchy. How disappointing not being able to have basmati rice at an Indian restaurant! According to mom, it seems that they may have confused sugar for salt in another one of their rice dishes, and the chicken tandoori was RAW and slimy. And of course not one more word from the staff.  I didn't even want to drink the replacement waters they had given us. We just ate as quickly as we could paid and left.

Will never go back.

The waitstaff took a while to notice I had sat down, but I was waiting for someone and specifically took a seat tucked away, so totally not their fault! Once they noticed me they were incredibly attentive and on top of everything. 

I had the fish and chips which were supposed to come with waffle fries but came with potato chips. Apparently they were out of Waffle fries, no big! But the option for regular fries would have been nice. (I don't really eat chips)

I stopped in on a marathon furniture shopping tour in the area and had the 2 thing combination; a cup of lemon chicken soup and the 1/2 chicken pomodoro panini.

I picked up a plastic cup for water, chose a seat by the window and the food took forever to get to me.  It was a Saturday at like 4:30 pm - only a couple other people in there at the same time...

When the food was brought to the table, I asked if I could have something else besides the chips that came with the meal (I didn't know I would get chips) and they told me I could have carrot sticks.  That sounded good.  They were those processed baby carrots in a bag...  Fail.

The soup was super light on the chicken and loaded with bell pepper pieces (my least favorite thing...). I tried to pick those out as much as possible.

The 1/2 sandwich was even light on the chicken.  Taste was pretty good, but the bread was really greasy - I dabbed as much out with napkins as possible.

I thought this place would have a little less processed everything but it appears they have processed everything.  

I did get a free oatmeal raisin cookie upon check-in and that was fantastic.  That's where the additional .5 star comes in.

These nachos are like none you've ever had and have to be experienced to understand why. You receive a generous portion of chips, baked beans, your choice of smoked meat (pork or turkey), and a warm layer of white jalapeno queso poured over this divine concoction. They give you a packet of sour cream and some barbecue sauce, but I have never seen the need since you have the cheese and the beans have just enough sauce, but this is just my personal preference. I know that this sounds like the standard recipe for nachos and any barbecue place around Nashville, but these are simply distinct and delicious. I think that the key differences are their bean recipe and the use of white over yellow queso. 

As a general rule, when it comes to barbeque I am a purist and only eat smoked pork or beef. Buck's smoked turkey is the rare exception to that rule. As a matter of fact, it is so good that since it is the first thing I tried from there, I haven't tried anything else on the menu and will have to update this review when I finally force myself to try the other ""real"" barbecue. The key to their turkey over other places I have tried, is that they pull their turkey from a whole turkey breast, while the others I have tried typically have a slice turkey that resembles something you would get sliced at a deli. 

 I have also tried the smoked turkey plate with baked beans, slaw, and a roll. The baked beans are a good balance of sweet, smoky, and savory. The slaw is a vinegar-based slaw that has a nice crunch and slight sweetness to counter the tartness of the vinegar. This slaw has absolutely no mayonnaise, which I feel is a nice, healthy change from the typical mayo laden slaw you usually receive at local barbecue joints. I don't have any nutritional info on this plate, but I imagine that it is light years healthier than a traditional barbecue plate and loaded with lean protein. Their barbecue sauce is a tomato based vinegary sauce with a nice peppery kick, but is not thick and sugary like many other sauces you will find.

I have never dined in, but the staff working the drive thru is always nice and efficient. They also have some great desserts, including banana pudding if you can possibly think about dessert after your meal. With just a short drive north, I promise you will find the best smoked turkey around Nashville and a great alternative when you want barbecue without the guilt.",2012-11-24 21:00:19,"{""Alcohol"": ""u'none'"", ""RestaurantsDelivery"": ""False"", ""WiFi"": ""u'no'"", ""OutdoorSeating"": ""False"", ""Caters"": ""True"", ""HasTV"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsTakeOut"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsGoodForGroups"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsAttire"": ""u'casual'"", ""NoiseLevel"": ""u'quiet'"", ""RestaurantsPriceRange2"": ""1"", ""BusinessAcceptsCreditCards"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsReservations"": ""False"", ""BikeParking"": ""True"", ""GoodForMeal"": ""{u'breakfast': None, u'brunch': None, u'lunch': True, u'dinner': None, u'latenight': None, u'dessert': None}"", ""GoodForKids"": ""True"", ""Ambience"": ""{u'divey': True, u'hipster': False, u'casual': None, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': None, u'classy': False, u'upscale': False}"", ""BusinessParking"": ""{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': True, u'validated': None}""}"

I think a cheesesteak needs a good about of cheese to steak ratio. Am I right?!? It was missing the cheese though. Bread was good, fresh roll. I like mine with a fried onion on top. It could use some more fried onion.

We let him know that we had a Groupon and he briefly explained the prix fixe menu - we didn't have to make very many decisions at all (soup or salad, fish or meat), the 4-course meal was already arranged for us.  It might sound funny to say that I appreciated this lack of selection for the Groupon but it really enhanced my experience - instead of having to think about every detail and choose from a long list of options, I just relaxed and enjoyed what the restaurant had put together for me.  It felt like having a good home-cooked meal at a dinner party with plenty of delightful surprises. 

The meal: We received a complimentary glass of house red wine, a salad with really delicious dressing, a simple pasta course (marinara sauce) followed by the fish we selected (a type of white fish with a lemon-y sauce), dessert (that kind of sponge-y Italian cake with frosting that has both chocolate and coffee flavors), and a surprise glass of house-made limoncello with dessert.

And I would call this one of those Reno institutions you just HAVE to try at some point.  So when the rating level says ""A-OK"", that is exactly what I think it means.  A solid, alright sort of joint.

Located in the Eldroado Casino, right in downtown, they are perfectly located to capitalize on the seething throngs of casino goers.  On many nights, you will often have quite the line forming out front, so I would advise trying to swing by on off days during the week if you can.  Inside, the ambiance is pretty much what you'd expect for a place in a casino.  Pretty boisterous, with tons of people enjoying their drinks, and lots of TV's to watch the game.  Service here is very friendly and usually quite prompt even on busier nights.

They have a nice beer selection here, with about half a dozen or so of their main flagships and rotating specialties on tap.  The Redhead Amber is not bad, as is the Big Dog, which is a pretty mellow IPA.  The Corano Special is a German-style Kolsch, which is very light and refreshing, and is probably one of those perfect sorts of beers to go with heavy bar food.  Their Double Down Stout I found to be a little on the light side for such a dark beer, but did have a sort of smokiness to it that I enjoyed, too.  They also brew their own root beer here in house, with free refills.  Prices for their beers are pretty cheap, with $5 for a 15-ounce glass, or $7 for a 22-ouncer.  Growler fills are also available should you find something you enjoy.  And of course, there is a full bar and even the adult slushy machine should you be in the mood for some other beverage.

Food options here consist of tons of pub favorites.  I can say the Brothers Burger is pretty tasty, no doubt.  The french fries I found a bit underwhelming.  But their pizzas are excellent, baked right in the big oven visible at the far end of the room.  I am personally a fan of the Margherita or even just the plain cheese ones.  Food prices, too, are quite reasonable, especially considering you are in a big hotel resort, with very few things on the menu above the $12-$14 range.

As I said, this is sort of one of those Reno establishments any local should try out at some point, especially if you want a complete picture of the brewery scene in our region.

It started to get more crowded as our meal went on, but it wasn't insanely loud/the wait staff wasn't running around. The only time we were kept waiting was when we were trying to get our bill--other than that the service was great. 

An amazing feature that their menu has is a combo meal for $9.99. It's great because it typically has three different items that you can try--I loved it because I got to try a bit of three different things--though some had two options. I got the #15 combo which consisted of a chicken quesadilla, a beef and cheese tostada, and taco. All three were fantastic, but I will say that the tostada was to die for--the cheese melted on top was delicious. My mom got the #7 combo consisting of an enchilada, chile relleno, and rice and beans. I tried some of the rice and it had the perfect amount of seasoning. She also loved the chile relleno because the seeds are removed which makes it less spicy and much more enjoyable. 

We both got drinks--I got a specialty drink that I can't remember the name of (something with a sunset) and she got a margarita, and both were amazing. The drinks were a bit pricey though, especially considering we got big meals for $9.99 each--I believe the drinks were only about $1 cheaper.

And the Tampa streets were a zoo.
We needed to find a place for lunch,
But I hadn't a clue what to do.

(And you wonder why they made me stop writing poetry for greeting cards....)

OK, so here's the deal, a group of my friends were heading over to the Ronald McDonald House to make dinner for the kids and their families who were staying at the home over the holiday season. Since the Ronald McDonald House is located right behind Tampa General Hospital, I figured that I could kidnap my girlfriend from a double-shift at the hospital, and grab a nice lunch on Davis Island before it was time to start cooking. Well, that was the plan anyway...

As luck would have it, it was a crazy time in the ER so Britt was only able to sneak away for a quick bite. After picking her up, we made a mad dash to the Davis Island business district and found an open parking space in front of 220 East. The restaurant is on the far end of a little bitty shopping strip, and it's a nice place to sit and have a delicious, yet casual meal.

The décor is a fun collection of kitschy antiques. My favorite was the gigantic carousel rooster that was staring down at me while I ate, but they also had an old 8mm movie projector, a typewriter, and assorted technologies from days gone by. The interior of the restaurant is a bit dark, but that makes the place seem even more cozy.

According to the information on their menu, 220 East proudly serves excellent food in a fun and casual setting which makes them a neighborhood favorite on Davis Island. Nul and David make all of their soups, sauces, and desserts from scratch in their kitchen.  They buy only best quality seafood, meat, and produce to help maintain their high standards and consistency. And, they have priced their menu to give their guests an outstanding value.

The lunchtime menu had some great options including baked Brie, pot stickers, tuna sashimi, fried calamari, and satay chicken for appetizers. Their French onion soup is AWESOME! They also have a lot of really tasty mixed greens and fruit salads, as well as a variety of soup & salad, and sandwich & salad options.

If you prefer, they also have sandwiches and burgers on the lunch menu, as well as more substantial lunch-sized entrées including a small filet, or fresh catch of the day fish, chicken marsala, chicken piccata, or pork margarita. 

I opted for a cup of their very delicious French onion soup, and then had a Black Jack Burger, which was seasoned with Cajun spices, then topped with melted jack cheese and sautéed mushrooms, and served on a toasted baguette with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and French fries on the side. 

The ""adorable one"" had 220's Field of Fruit salad, which was organic field greens tossed with balsamic vinaigrette, then topped with mandarin oranges, crumbled bleu cheese, strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, and walnuts.

We're anxious to go back to 220 East and have a more relaxed meal after the Holidays. The dinner menu has a lot of seafood and pasta dishes, and they have a small wine cellar right near the front door. This looks like a great place to sit back and enjoy a nice dinner with a glass of wine.",2014-12-26 22:28:55,"{""OutdoorSeating"": ""True"", ""NoiseLevel"": ""u'average'"", ""Ambience"": ""{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}"", ""RestaurantsTakeOut"": ""True"", ""HasTV"": ""True"", ""BusinessAcceptsCreditCards"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsPriceRange2"": ""2"", ""BikeParking"": ""True"", ""Alcohol"": ""u'full_bar'"", ""RestaurantsReservations"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsDelivery"": ""False"", ""GoodForKids"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsAttire"": ""u'casual'"", ""BusinessParking"": ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", ""WiFi"": ""'no'"", ""RestaurantsGoodForGroups"": ""True"", ""GoodForMeal"": ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}""}"

I live behind the (now closed) Rouses on Vets, so it is convenient to just walk over there and not have to deal with parking.
My first visit, I had the Swamp Burger w/cheese and onion rings. Perfect medium-rare burger, the rings were piping hot, and the beer was ice cold. Went in mid-afternnon for a burger and a beer, stayed until around 8. I was hooked from day one. 
To those that say the wait staff is inattentive, it might be your attitude when you come in. I used to be a bartender, and if rude people kept flagging me down, they would wait longer. They don't come to your table to take your order, you go to the bar. They will get your order. 
The food is good, fresh, and made when you order it. If you want a burger in 3 minutes, McDonald's is across the street.
My verdict: Great, laid-back dive bar with better than average bar food. Not to mention plenty of TVs, pool tables, dartboards, video games, and video poker, if that is your thing.
Recommendations: The Swamp Burger, Onion Rings, boudin balls, wings, and potato skins.

Located in a small shopping plaza next to some eclectic shops, very small, but they definitely make the most of the space. Cute restaurant with a homey feel. As we walked in, there was a young man playing guitar and singing some of our favorite alternative songs, which added that extra ambiance to our meal. He was really good and not overly loud so you couldn't hear each other. 

We were told to choose a table and have a seat, as there were several open on a Saturday at 12:30pm, but the place was buzzing. We chose a seat next to the musician. Our server was great, answered questions about the menu, and was very attentive. There were actually quite a few servers in the place, making for prompt service. Our food even came quick, so they've got their kitchen operation down as well! We ended up ordering the fresh-squeezed orange juice, which comes in a mason jar in a pretty large portion, and it was delicious. Not too pulpy and nice and cold. I ordered the morning after omelette and added mushrooms, with wheat toast and potatoes, and also a bowl of fresh fruit.  All of the ingredients were very fresh, and it was delicious. I've had better homefries, they were just a little bland and could do with some seasoning, but they were still pretty good with some added salt/pepper. My boyfriend had the southwest omelette and he called it a ""joy-gasm in his mouth"" haha. So he approves. 

The whole meal, included OJ, our omelettes, and the two sides of fruit came to less than $30. We had a groupon for $28 worth of food for $14 so it was a really good deal, but I'd gladly pay full price for an experience like this.

Marrero, however, has them all beat with as many as 20 flavors to choose from.  Sometimes, not all of these options are available (and it seems like my favorite, Cake Batter, has been in short supply lately).

To accommodate all those flavor options, the shop itself is huge.  There's plenty of seating, including big booths for large groups to sit together and enjoy their yogurt.  

The space is also kept very clean, which I know must be a challenge at a place that is self-serve.  I often see the employees vacuuming the topping areas to keep it mess-free, especially after a large crowd of customers breezes through.

Speaking of the employees, they have always been very personable and helpful.  There is always someone there to give samples of any flavor that I might want to try before I commit to an entire cup of it.  Everyone there really seems to enjoy their job, which makes me feel welcome as a customer.

He went with a grilled cheese sandwich. It came out on a hamburger bun with LOTS of thick cheddat cheese. He ate the whole thing. He loves cheese so this was a natural for him. 
He also had a chocolate and black cherry malt. Wow, it was delicious and chocolatey. We are wondering where the black cherry is though. He wanted a whole cherry. None were found nor was there a taste of it. 
I ordered a burger, of course. It came cooked medium to medium well. It was delicious and obviously fresh, not a frozen type of premade that you get in fast food places. 
The condiments I ordered were also of fresh quality. 
I ordered a side of fries. It is a large serving and was easily shared. The fries are freshly made, not the frozen kind. They are cooked in olive oil. The fries were thinly cut and natural. A slight burned taste with them, like the flavor of a shoe string potatoe chip. 
The location is clean with a blue and white decor. There is ample seating. 
When you eat in they bring the food to your table in a metal pan. It is not served fast so you might as well sit down and wait. They call your name and bring it over.

I think it opened about 4 months ago from the time of this review.

It has very good food and our server was very friendly. However, this place didn't honor our reservation time on a Friday night. We waited over a half hour past our 8pm reservation time before we were seated. The appetizers and drinks came in a reasonable timeframe, but we must have waited 40 minutes between our appetizers and when our entrees were served.

I had to send my grilled flat iron steak back, since it was cooked well-done and I had asked for medium. That fix added an additional 10 minutes. By the time we got out of there, it was 10:15pm.

You may need to valet your car if it's crowded. It's complimentary, but it would seem tipping is encouraged. At least I wouldn't feel right if I didn't. And the valet in our case, and from observing others who were waiting, took about 10 minutes per car.

Also, the restaurant has an open floor space arrangement. It was a little loud with an open kitchen nearby and no solid acoustical construction to absorb sound.

In conclusion, if you don't mind having a 2+ hour dinner and can handle the moderate noise, you will be fine. Since the place is still very new, I think they have a few kinks to work out, such as making sure all the cooks are on point and being more stringent on service time and reservations.",2017-02-11 15:18:53,"{""RestaurantsAttire"": ""u'dressy'"", ""GoodForMeal"": ""{'dessert': None, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", ""DogsAllowed"": ""False"", ""RestaurantsReservations"": ""True"", ""BusinessAcceptsCreditCards"": ""True"", ""Alcohol"": ""u'full_bar'"", ""RestaurantsTableService"": ""True"", ""BusinessParking"": ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': True}"", ""WiFi"": ""'free'"", ""OutdoorSeating"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsGoodForGroups"": ""True"", ""BikeParking"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsTakeOut"": ""True"", ""Ambience"": ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", ""GoodForKids"": ""True"", ""NoiseLevel"": ""u'average'"", ""RestaurantsPriceRange2"": ""3"", ""Caters"": ""True"", ""HasTV"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsDelivery"": ""True""}"

When we entered we weree seated right away by smiling and friendly faces. 

The menu had a nice variety of items to choose from so we tried all different appetizers. We ended up getting crab bites, chicken wings, shrimp po boys and we shared them. 

Never really had crab before but tasted the crab bites they were pretty good. When it came to the main meal I got the Mardi Gras boil  which came with crawfish, shrimp, and mussels, corn cob and potatoes in a Cajun sauce. Everyone at my  table got some form of boil, with crab legs, shrimp, or mussels. 

The boils were steaming hot and the sauce it came in was flavorful. 

The dessert had many options and I ended  up getting the key lime cheesecake, carrot cake that was gluten free and my boyfriend got the waffle with ice cream. Everyone else got the waffle and chocolate cake and raspberry creme  brûlée. I tasted a little of each dessert, but my favorites were the chocolate cake and cheesecake.

This experience was a great one and I'd definitely come back again inn the near future. 

The portions were so big- I actually had some to take home.

Ok, all joking aside, this is ONE OF THE BEST bars I've ever been to.  The decor makes you feel classy even though you probably aren't.  The food tastes amazing and makes you think you're getting a deal because it's so reasonably priced.  The bartenders and servers are very down to earth which rounds the whole experience out.  It's just a completely honest place that has won a spot in my heart.

Varga has an extremely impressive and rotating beer selection.  This is due in part to Ian, the bartender with whom I'm most familiar.  You can actually sit and talk beer with this guy for hours.  His choices are aggressive and he knows how to write-up each brew in a way that everyone can relate to.  I've drank plenty of beers in my day but I'll read a quick description at Varga and think ""hrmm, I don't remember that flavor in that beer""  The next think you know, you have a pint of it in front of you.  That is business savvy right there.

The food, in a word, awesome.  I realize that I've become truly spoiled living in Philadelphia in regards to food.  Any ""gastropub"" in Philly has to bring their best to the table if they just want to survive.  I think Varga is one of the top contenders in this realm.  I can honestly say that everything that comes out of that kitchen is great.  They do happen to have the best wings I've ever tasted.  Their wings, in case you were wondering, are so tender that the meat falls off the bone when you pick one up.  That's worth the price of admission alone.  The Varga salad, just plain wonderful.  Lots of flavors playing very well together and light enough to make you feel like you aren't undoing all your gym activity.  They've been featuring oysters recently and that is something that makes me very happy.  The first night I had oysters at Varga, I had them with the Victory Scarlet Fire.  Oh my God.  A super smoky beer with oysters on a hot summer night and only three blocks from my home, does life really get any better than this?  These are the kind of things you think about when you're a patron of Varga.

The menu looked great.  I decided on a special though.  It was a knockwurst sandwich with Swiss cheese and an egg.  It was everything I could ever want it to be.  Absolutely wonderful.  My girlfriend got the Mac and Cheese which she said was equally as good.  We traded bites and it was delicious.  Creamy, hearty and tangy all at the same time.

They have a great selection of craft and Import beers.  I tried a couple different ones and even used the bartenders knowledge of the brews a bit.

When you enter The Marketplace, there is a really nice atmosphere. There is a full bar, a barista station, and a case featuring pastries. The menu has a good variety for whatever you are feeling, even for breakfast! There are vegan options, vegetarian options, and if you're a meat lover, I hear from a friend the bacon is pretty phenomenal! 

As you can see there is lovely presentation on the plate. My avocado toast was accompanied by arugula (my favorite!) and a strawberry. It was absolutely delicious! I've tried the black coffee and the espresso as well. Black coffee was meh. If you're looking for something really impressive, go to one of the nearby specialty shops. The espresso here at Maynard's wasn't too bad, though!

The indoor seating features cute wooden tables, and there is a HUGE patio outside if you're looking to get some sun. This place is really cute, and as of now is my favorite place to go out and get breakfast here in Tucson.

The service, good, but pushy and presumptive. The waitress took it upon herself to preorder special desserts for us, then we, of course, were in an uncomfortable position after the main course when we told her we weren't interested.

Cost - overpriced, considering the dining hall feel to the place. If I want to be in a crowded loud place, there are plenty of restaurants in New Orleans that are half the price.

We called ahead for a party of 7. Then got lost walking in the pouring rain from our hotel. Haha. They were expecting us and had a table waiting for us as soon as we walked in the door. The hosts were friendly and very knowledgable. 

We got the pretzels for an appetizer and they were wonderful!(the dark sauce is NOT the cheese like you would expect. Haha.)

Our drinks were served quickly, refilled promptly and while my husband and I didn't drink any of the beer, my brother and his wife did and they were very impressed with everything they tried. 

The food was wonderful. The umms and ohhhhs while eating never stopped. The brisket on a biscuit was a huge his and my chicken stew and biscuits were mouth watering. The kids(9,12 & 16) were impressed and even with a lack of children's menu, the staff was quick to recommend quite a few child pleasing dishes that pleased them all!

This is located at Lafayette and 9th across the street from Bogarts.  
The building is very cool w/ a garage door style opening in the front.  The place is all exposed brick, wood and girders so very urban and cool.  Unfortunately since there is so much brick and the ceilings are so tall....it was really loud in there and everyone had to yell.  When we came in we left our cell number with the host.  They will then text you when your table is ready.  I wish more places did that.
We sat at the bar and ordered drinks.  Our bartenders were very helpful and nice.  One of the things that I really love about Mission is their cocktail selection.  I order the Delmar Boulevardier and when they made it they lit the inside of the glass on fire....so this is a great drink to order while at the bar.  It was really good too.
We started off with the chips and salsa and one was mild and one was hotter....but we felt that they were both kinda hot. 
We also ordered an assortment of tacos (fish, steak and pork) and some street corn and jasmine rice (I've never had that before here).  Everything we got was really good.  
I think that our server was Daniel and he did a great job and was very attentive.

It has plenty of seating and a cute patio. I think the coffee here is pretty good - it doesn't blow me away like some other shops, but it is, legitimately, good coffee. I appreciate that the lattes I've gotten here taste strong and not watered down. I love not having to order extra shots of espresso because of weak coffee. 
I have yet to try the food but it always smells great in there.

Something that bothered me the last time I was here was that the wifi doesn't ""open"" until 11am. I get the feeling that the shop is trying to create a social environment where people are interacting with one another instead of on their phones (because there's a sign specifically asking customers not to use phones indoors). However, I think this is an issue. Many coffee shop goers go to do work and if they can't access the internet, that's a problem. This is what happened to me - came to do work at around 10am only to discover that I couldn't do any research until 11. I think this issue is further stressed given that 1) it's so close to campus and 2) there's a very well known, very popular shop less than one block over. I write this in hopes that the owners open the internet for as long as the shop is open.

I'm not really sure whether I'd like to give Raging Sage 3 stars or 4.

This review is a bit belated as I went about 10 days ago, the day after the grand re-opening. 

The interior looks largely the same, while the menu got a total makeover. Gone are the $35 unlimited hot pot and Sichuan dishes, replaced by dim sum. I would have liked to see a few more traditional dishes, but it had most of the major stuff catering to a Rittenhouse crowd. (The prices were in Rittenhouse dollars as well.)

We ordered a few different dishes: hot and sour soup, turnip cake, scallion pancakes, Brussels sprouts (why were these on a dim sum menu?), fried dumplings, crab and pork soup dumplings, and pork belly with mustard greens, which came with a side of rice. 

I knocked off a star because while most dishes were good, the turnip cake was a total miss - quite a bit overdone. I didn't find anything particularly memorable that I would come back for. We did experience quite a few issues with ordering as the kitchen had run out of a few items due to reopening the day before; I completely understand but the issue was that our server (while very nice) was not prepared with this info and had to keep coming back to us to let us know the kitchen was missing something, after we had already ordered.

Lots of fresh options and a slew of ways to customize your bowl/smoothie so that you get the supreme combination of nutrients and flavors you're looking for. 

Here's the catch: I consistently experience a little bit of spacy-ness from the staff, which usually translates to my order coming out wrong. This wouldn't be a big deal if I could eat granola or honey, but I can't.  So when they overlook my request to swap out granola for chopped almonds, or too quickly douse my bowl in honey before I can yell, ""NOOOOOOOO!"" I have to be THAT customer who is like, ""Uh, I'm afraid I can't eat this.""  If this had only happened once, I wouldn't be writing this review.  But it happens on a regular basis, so they get 3/5 stars.  I just hate wasting food. 

All that being said, some top performing menu items - provided you don't mind if they are made to spec or not - are the Popeye smoothie, the Diego bowl and the Island bowl. 

The Diego is a dense, satisfying bowl - particularly in the Large size. The peanut butter sits with you for long stretches of the day, and I usually forget to eat several meals after having one of these.  Not as sweet as the other bowls, but extremely filling. 

The Island is SWEET - even if you forego the honey. Something about the blueberry/banana/strawberry combination is enough to keep you shoveling bites of this bowl down before you can even think to breathe. Doesn't always keep you full for long stretches of time - likely due to the sugar crash you have an hour or so after eating it.  Regardless, if you're looking for a sweet smoothie-esque experience, this is your ticket. 

The Popeye smoothie is everything a green smoothie should be. Nutrient dense, flavorful, refreshing and this crazy vibrant green color - it ups your healthy-eater cred without you even really trying.",2012-09-03 23:51:48,"{""RestaurantsAttire"": ""u'casual'"", ""BusinessAcceptsCreditCards"": ""True"", ""BikeParking"": ""True"", ""Alcohol"": ""u'none'"", ""NoiseLevel"": ""u'average'"", ""Ambience"": ""{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}"", ""OutdoorSeating"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsTakeOut"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsGoodForGroups"": ""True"", ""DogsAllowed"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsReservations"": ""False"", ""GoodForKids"": ""True"", ""HasTV"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsTableService"": ""False"", ""Caters"": ""False"", ""WiFi"": ""u'no'"", ""BusinessParking"": ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", ""HappyHour"": ""False"", ""RestaurantsDelivery"": ""None"", ""RestaurantsPriceRange2"": ""2"", ""GoodForMeal"": ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': True}""}"

Food: Had the House special beef noodle soup and opted for the shaved noodles. Was really delicious- the shaved noodles are nice and chewy (QQ), slightly thicker (which I really like), and have a good bite to them. The meat was nice and tender and flavorful and the veggies and broth were also good. Also had the scallion pancake and it was nice and crunchy, flavorful, and the slightly sweet dipping sauce was nice as well.

Value: Shines here- 8-9 bucks for a bowl of noodles and 2.75 for the scallion pancake. Back home in Cupertino, where there is an abundance of delicious Chinese/Taiwanese food, a bowl of noodle soup like that would easily cost me 12-13 bucks and 4-5 for the scallion pancakes. Yay for better values here. Cash only FYI though they have an ATM on site.

Ambiance: Nothing fancy but not a hole in the wall either. Plenty of seating, nice enough tables, non-throwaway chopsticks.

We went on a Wednesday night, and the three of us sat outside on the patio. We brought a couple bottles of wine (corkage is $20/bottle). The food is reportedly served family style. We started with the fried, goat cheese-stuffed Castelvetrano olives, and moved on to Caramelized Cauliflower Gratin, Little Gems 'Wedge' salad, Pork Belly Sliders, and Whole Grilled Branzino. For dessert, we had the Chocolate Pot Du Creme and the Meyer Lemon Tart. 

The food was generally OK. The Cauliflower Gratin and Pork Belly Sliders were the best of the dishes we ordered. The portions were fairly small, especially for a family-style approach. I don't think it really is family-style, but that's what they're telling people.

There was something not right about the Lemon Tart. It tasted like liver pate. All three of us tasted this. We pointed it out to our waiter and he said something like ""let me check that out"" and basically never returned. We were charged for the tart nonetheless.

Seated right away with a glass of water. We were told the specials.  I asked if the moussaka was available and she said she made one that day. 
Orders taken in a timely fashion. For wine, the Boutari is probably your best bet.  Only $5.00 more than the house wine. 
Lovely, gigantic portions served up quickly.  Lamb shank was a winner.  My moussaka ($30) was to die for. The pork souvlaki was also tasty and the Pastitsio was huge.  Had to be taken home.  All came with rice, roasted potatoes, buttery green beans and carrots. The Pastitsio came with Greek salad instead of veggies.
They accidentally spilled my mom's tea onto her dinner so they gave her a new order immediately with a new tea.  They apologized all over the place.  We got a huge piece of freshly baked baklava to share and a cup of coffee on the house.  
This lady hosts, cooks and serves.  Her fella also serves and busses.  She told us she is from Cyprus. Shared a story about desserts from her childhood.

I have to admit that my exposure to Vietnamese Street food is fairly limited so I didn't venture outside my comfort zone all that much on my first viI ordered the Pork Street Tacos which were really good! There is no price on the menu for them which I thought was very odd considering pretty much everything else on the menu had a set price.  I don't particularly like surprises when it comes to menu pricing.  I ordered two and hoped for the best.  For $8.50 they were way too stingy on the ingredients. Two small but tasty flat strips of marinated pork, slaw and a really yummy sauce. I think three would have made a great dinner size but keep it at $8.50 or maybe 3 for $9.  I think that is more than fair. My husband ordered the Steak Rice Bun Noodles ($9.95) and added the egg roll for an add'l ($2.00).  Not worth $12.  Again, pretty skimpy on the flavorful meat and heavy handed on the lettuce and slaw.  Also, the egg roll cut in half on the side of the ""salad"" was disappointing.  The pricing should have been two egg rolls for something like $2.25.  I think he would have been better off ordering the Steak Rice meal. Perhaps it would have been more filling. He left feeling hungry. The Spring Rolls looked beautiful and were pretty good but it was basically the same meal that my husband ordered just rolled up.  The peanut dipping sauce was yummy.  I would go here again maybe for lunch as those tacos were my favorite of the evening but I don't think they were worth the price.  I did see someone order the Bahn Mi and he too had a very small portion of meat. It was mostly greens.  Didn't look anything like picture #4 posted above.  That one looked staged for advertising purposes.  I can't imagine he didn't hit a drive thru after leaving there.  I will say the staff was awesome! Very friendly and attentive.

We had been to ST Pete beach 3 years ago and had read all the rave reviews about the place and ate there twice, even driving an hour back up because of how
Good the food and service was and since we were going to be driving from lake city back to Orlando, we decided to drive back here to have a special meal.   After reading many of the most recent reviews on here and TripAdvisor, I was a little leery because of all the complaints on the food, the service, the lack of caring by staff and mgmt and the length of time for orders or orders being incorrect.  Well all that was true and I'm kicking myself for thinking differently as my dinner was just plain horrible.  

We went at 8:00 tonight and it was half full.  We were seated and drinks were ordered and brought to the table.  Then a different server, Juan was the name on the receipt, came and took our food order.   Of course he didn't write it down or remember it correctly, as you can see where I'm going with this.  We get two pasta dishes, veggie lasagne and gnocchi and 2 Caesar salads.  Pretty simple
Order.   The salads come fairly quickly and only have 2 small croutons on the top.   So it's basically a bowl of romaine with light dressing a sprinkle of cheese and 2 small croutons. Ridiculous considering many of the  complaints have been about ""things changing, going downhill, etc "". Then we wait 20-25 min for entrees and they finally come and as Juan is sitting my plate down he asks me if I had the gnocchi or some other lasagne?  Come on bro.  I told him I had the gnocchi and he left and said he would
Be right back.  Well my girl is halfway finished with her dish and mine is still nowhere.   He finally comes back and I ask how long it's going to take because we would like to eat together and he says 5 minutes.  Easily didn't care.  So I told him to cancel it and he said ok.   Of course No manager ever came by, no apology,   All he did to try to recover was ask if I wanted an extra plate to split my girls lasagne after she was half done.  What an idiot.  Didn't offer anything else,  no manager nada.  Then brings it out to go anyways after I told him to cancel it.  I get it that he was trying to be nice but I told
Him I was in a hotel and that's why I said cancel it.  H said oh ok you need a ride?  No dipshit I have a car.   I  wanted dinner on time and correct instead of you blaming the cooks.  That drives me crazy.  You didn't remember the order, you put it in the  computer, you carried the wrong order to the table then blamed it on the cooks to try and save your tip.  Well that didn't work either.  Bad hire, bad training, bad food quality reduction, and clearly no one really caring- just like all the previous bad reviews.

Although lassi are dense, the milkshakes, juice, and shaved ice are light. They are good alternatives on hot days as last night was. 

First, we had watermelon juice - fresh and pulpy. Next we sampled a vanilla and date milkshake which was delicious. The chewy dates at the bottom of the shake reminded me of bubble tea. He also served us a couple of variants of shaved ice which were not unlike parfait; there was cut fruit at the bottom of the cup along with crushed ice topped with light syrups. The syrup flavors were rose and sandalwood! He also provided a similar shaved ice with pineapple.

The iced tea tasted fresh brewed from real tea bags and not the powdered stuff.  I asked for it with extra lime and was actually given LIME (and extra slices in a small dish on the side) not lemon.  In most places, requesting lime instead of lemon seems to stymie most servers.  Major brownie points.

My only complaint is about the chips and salsa.  Granted, it's complimentary but the chips were thin and flavorless.  The salsa was ok.  I ordered the ahi tacos.  I have to say they were amazing.  The ahi was fresh and well-seasoned.  My friend ordered the upside down nachos.  The portion was generous, meriting a to-go box.  

Our server was friendly but not overbearing.  Drink refills were offered quickly.  Our food arrived within 10 minutes of ordering.  We sat for awhile and chatted but were not made to feel like we were taking up space.  Being an ex-server I know how irritating  it is when diners ""campout"" at a table because in places like this, faster table turnovers equal more tips.

For Christmas my mom always does the traditional meal - turkey/ham/potatoes/green beans/corn/salad/rolls/etc. - but every year since I can remember she always does an ethnic side dish. We've had Mexican, Filipino, Greek, Thai, Puerto Rican, Ethiopian, Italian, Venezuelan, Indian, Cuban, etc. and recently within the last few years we've relied on Global Foods for the unique spices or ingredients those dishes call for. Luckily for us Global usually carries a couple varieties of said ingredient/spice so we have options to chose from!

Not only do they have a great variety of fresh, frozen & packaged items, but the aisles (outside of perishable items) are organized by country which makes it so much easier to find what you need! But if you still can't find an item, ask one of the friendly associates to help you!

So next time you're creating a unique dish or have a craving for something specific, go to Global Foods!

Exploring almost all of Philadelphia, this beautiful city, along with the outskirts for that one perfect Mediterranean/Middle Eastern dish has been an adventure. Mind you this hasn't been easy , some have also been costly in our expedition. With the establishments I (we) have been to in and around the city, our taste buds have experienced the great, down to the sub par. 

This has all come to fruition my friends with Apricot Stone being in Northern Liberties. I want to thank Sari, my partner in crime in joining me on this savory journey. 

Apricot Stone is literally a ""hidden gem"" located in Northern Liberties of all places. Not that I have anything against No. Libs. mind you. We came here one night for dinner and we immediately knew we had to come back .  

If you decide to come here for dinner you will be amazed, or if you decide on brunch you'll be overwhelmed by it. It is pretty safe to say you'd be in an euphoric bliss in which ever route you decide on.  Enough of the explaining, let me show you what I enjoyed with dinner along with brunch.  I also want to point out their hummus is the best I have ever tasted, Zahav is a close second in my opinion.  

Dinner: 
Kebab Tasting plate~ I highly recommend if you were to go for dinner. This is where you choose 3 items along with a dip to enjoy and a salad. The dish I had prepared consisted of : Chicken shawarma, falafel, lamb kebab were my main. My dip and salad were an eggplant salsa to go with an Israeli salad that which consisted of tomatoes and cucumbers in a homemade dressing. This is not a small plate by the way, our dishes were over flowing, with a ridiculous cost of $15.00. No that is not a typo, for $15 dollars you'll be enjoying an amazing dinner. 

Now onto Sunday brunch where we  could hardly contain ourselves, knowing what is ahead of us.  Sunday Funday  is upon us, and why not share our enjoyment with another Yelper that we all know and love with Mariella S. Pop that bottle, bring on the mimosas because this will definitely put you at full tilt. My brunch, which was another over flowing dish by the way. This is also a considered a ""Chefs tasting menu"" for a whopping $20.00 dollars. Shhhh I know, now please read on. 
 
*Mamounia~ This is a very sweet dish that is a cream of wheat, made with pistachio with their homemade cheese. A little too sweet for me, but still very good. 
*Zakhtar bread~ This is a flatbread that has been covered with their herbs and spices that has a crunchy flavorful taste to it .   
*Khachapri~ This is a dish that is bad ass, that needs to be ordered. It is their own homemade dough shaped like a boat stuffed with cheese that has been baked with an egg sunny side up over top. Bruh.. UHHH-maz-ING, this is what I consider winning all day.
*Falafel salad~ One larger than life falafel over a bed of lettuce mixed with cucumbers and tomatoes. 
*Apricot Crumb Cake~ Like we could eat any more , they push it to the limit with this. An apricot jam filled crumb cake that will have you screaming obscenities, that's how good it is.  

The space may not be big, but what they do is utilize the space they do have. Almost to the point where it would feel like you are sitting at home.  A  comforting atmosphere with also outside seating if you would like to dine alfresco. 

I also want to thank Susan G.(former Yelper) for pointing me in the direction of  this phenomenal restaurant.  Everyone should find the time , and simply take in one of or better yet all of their amazing dishes. I still want to try their well known Baklava with walnuts , the last 2 times I (we) have been in there, they have been sold out.  

I plan on coming back to this gem of all gems, so get ready Mrs. Fimy. Also if you could put aside a piece of the baklava I would greatly appreciate it, I'll even call ahead of time.",2016-07-26 14:56:33,"{""Alcohol"": ""u'none'"", ""HappyHour"": ""False"", ""BYOB"": ""True"", ""HasTV"": ""False"", ""Caters"": ""True"", ""GoodForKids"": ""True"", ""BusinessAcceptsCreditCards"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsGoodForGroups"": ""True"", ""ByAppointmentOnly"": ""False"", ""RestaurantsTableService"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsAttire"": ""u'casual'"", ""Ambience"": ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': None, 'divey': False, 'intimate': None, 'trendy': None, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': True}"", ""BusinessAcceptsBitcoin"": ""False"", ""BusinessParking"": ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", ""RestaurantsDelivery"": ""True"", ""NoiseLevel"": ""u'average'"", ""DriveThru"": ""False"", ""RestaurantsReservations"": ""True"", ""WheelchairAccessible"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsTakeOut"": ""True"", ""WiFi"": ""u'free'"", ""BikeParking"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsPriceRange2"": ""2"", ""OutdoorSeating"": ""True"", ""GoodForMeal"": ""{u'breakfast': False, u'brunch': None, u'lunch': None, u'dinner': True, u'latenight': False, u'dessert': True}""}"

She actually went into the back and grabbed a pack that were so fresh they were really hot. I am a huge fan of good flour tortillas especially when they're made right and they're fresh. These are some of the best I have ever had and I hope someday to come back to Tucson and experience more of these. Even if you have to drive from the other side of town they are worth it. Thank you very much to the friendly woman behind the counter because you started my day off with a smile and a wonderful breakfast!,2020-07-16 02:31:02,"{""RestaurantsTakeOut"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsPriceRange2"": ""1"", ""BusinessAcceptsCreditCards"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsDelivery"": ""False"", ""BusinessParking"": ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", ""BikeParking"": ""True"", ""Caters"": ""True""}"

formerly ramen boy, this place has matured significantly and the food offerings are much better after they re-branded as terakawa (a welcome import from NY) and switched chefs. 

the broth for the ramen is really consistent (many other places in philly are good some days, and sub-par on other days) and offers a very balanced taste - not too overly seasoned but very flavorful. definitely get the terakawa noodles in everything, including the tan tan noodles which normally come with another type of noodle (the terakawa noodles are the best). 

a very nicely done decor but not a lot of fluff (which is good - nom nom is overly ""fast food"" like with a mcdonalds feel, and hiro is a direct ripoff of this place that doesn't quite measure up). 

i would recommend the octopus balls, the pork buns, and the gyoza - all very well done and reasonably priced. i especially like the fact that you can get many appetizer pairings with ramen as a lunch special - very convenient.",2012-10-15 16:47:20,"{""HasTV"": ""False"", ""Alcohol"": ""u'none'"", ""RestaurantsAttire"": ""u'casual'"", ""BikeParking"": ""True"", ""WiFi"": ""u'no'"", ""RestaurantsPriceRange2"": ""2"", ""RestaurantsReservations"": ""False"", ""BusinessAcceptsCreditCards"": ""True"", ""RestaurantsTakeOut"": ""True"", ""Caters"": ""False"", ""NoiseLevel"": ""u'average'"", ""BusinessParking"": ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", ""RestaurantsGoodForGroups"": ""True"", ""GoodForKids"": ""True"", ""OutdoorSeating"": ""False"", ""GoodForMeal"": ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", ""DogsAllowed"": ""False"", ""HappyHour"": ""False"", ""Ambience"": ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}"", ""RestaurantsDelivery"": ""True""}"

My mom and I split a variety of dishes during our most recent visit. Golden tofu, Khao Soi with shrimp (the special of the day), and crab fried rice. We definitely had leftovers, but felt like trying a little bit of this and a little bit of that :) I would recommend all three items, especially the Khao Soi soup. It was the perfect blend of sweet (from the coconut milk broth), salty, and crunchy. The noodles were super tasty.

PROS:
Cute interior. They always have nice, seasonal touches. See photos for Easter themed decor.

Big portions! A lot of bang for your buck.

Great service. I've never been disappointed with the wait staff or the wait time.

Delicious!

The decor there is very homey and nice, and the staff are always helpful and very nice. At Dough Nation, they offer ice cream and egg-free cookie dough. This means that, yes, you can eat the cookie dough without having to worry about getting sick. My personal flavor is Double Chocolate Oreo. They offer many flavors like Chocolate Chip, Toasted S'more, Sweet and Salty, Red Velvet, and M&M. You could eat the cookie dough, or even take it home and bake it at 350 degrees in any conventional oven to make delicious cookies.

As soon as you walk through the door you are greeted warmly by the owners or staff. I go here often with my coworkers for lunch. The food is fresh and comes out pretty fast. 

If your lucky Mama will be walking around talking to everyone at their tables. Fun fact: she opened the first Thai Restaurant in New Orleans, which my mom frequented often back then.  

They have gluten free items on the menu marked clearly for you to see and can modify some dishes to accommodate to gluten-free, just ask and they will let you know. I really love that when ordering and inquiring about the menu and modifications they seem very knowledgeable and don't make you feel like a huge pain in the @ss. 

They have rice and glass noodles which are gluten free and if your going the low carb route you can't lose with their curry! Ask for a extra veggies to bulk it up if your not eating rice because you'll want to eat up all of the yummy sauce! 

I was in the mood for Pad Thai and asked if they could make it gluten free. While my dish was yummy and I very much enjoyed it, the modification left it not tasting like Pad Thai, it was missing the sweetness from the tamarind. That being said it was still a delicious meal and left quite satisfied. 

I really have no complaints when I eat here. The staff is very attentive and willing to make sure you have a wonderful time.

We had mainstays of any Chinese menu - sweet & sour chicken, General Tso's chicken, egg rolls, and a Chinese Pizza/Scallion Pancake. The disappointment got underway quickly.

The Sweet & Sour didn't come with enough sauce. The General Tso was ""meh"", and the scallion pancake was downright terrible.

We ordered the agedashi tofu, shrimp tempura tofu, smoked salmon, fluke, and yellowtail nigiri, their Rock N Roll special roll, and their Shochu samplers.

I'll start with the decor. It's very ultra white, space age modern looking. Interesting take on decor for a sushi restaurant, of which I'm not sure if I am a fan but I can't say I hate it, either.

Now for the food. The agedashi tofu was nothing special, i.e. don't bother ordering this dish. The shrimp tempura udon was pretty good, but not fantastic. I did like how they served the 2 shrimp tempura on the side so that it doesn't get too soggy in the broth. It also came with a zucchini tempura fritter.

The nigiri was pretty much to my expectation, although they did something weird to the smoked salmon and yellowtail that made it look like the texture of cube steak. It was very odd and I assume its purpose is to tenderize the fish. The Rock N Roll was a commitment. Each piece, or roll, was pretty thick and stuffed with both salmon and tuna, then topped with ""crunchy"" topping and a sweet eel sauce. The waitress explained that it is called eel sauce because they mix in powdered eel. I have no idea what that is.

Almost seems like the people on the side are eagerly anticipating what you're going to order...what's it going to be today? Well, let me give you a recommendation: try the Yangnyum wings, either bone-in or boneless. You will not be disappointed. It's a mixture of sweet and spicy, with small peanuts on top. You don't even need to get rice that normally comes with the wings. Let the wings speak for themselves, and if spicy stuff gives you fits, make sure you have some water or milk handy.

Also suggest requiring orders of 10 or more to be online.  At least twice I've been waiting in line and people in front of me have a list of 10, yes 10, or more orders.

Brief history of the crepe it was created by mistake by a 14 year old assistant.Nick and I stopped by at Kaffe Crepe after his flight landed. Naturally we were both famished. Kaffe is a charming and quaint place. There is a huge selection of crepes to chose from; breakfast, lunch, and dessert. We ordered  The Cookie Butter (Biscoff cookie spread & crumbs, banana, and vanilla sugar) Huevos Rancheros (cheese blend, eggs, green tomatillos sauce ,Avocado and choice of meat) and the Chicken, Pesto & Mushroom (Cheese blend, grilled chicken, pesto, mushrooms, roasted bell peppers, and spinach). You order/pay at the counter and they bring your food out to your table. We were surprised at how big the portions were!

We decide to do the eat and drink and then take home some of their goodies. We found they did Turkish coffee in the correct manner and style. A good caffeine kick and the deep taste and aroma of Turkish coffee. With our coffee, we shared a Croissant shaped pastry, but filled with jam. Wonderful! We also shared a Poppyseed Roll which was so light and delicious.

We decided to take home what turned out to be 3 boxes of pastries: Turkish Bagel, Afghan flat bread, another jam roll,  another poppyseed roll, 3 cookies, 2 Baklavas. and a jam donut (much like a Portuguese Florshe/donut). Dessert with tonight's dinner and breakfast tomorrow from all these goodies.

We asked about call in orders and they said a day ahead of time would be good. So when we want a dozen of their poppyseed rolls, that is what we will do.

I guess I should explain why this place is amazing. I have noticed this place for years since I've been passing by here countless times. It wasn't until I started working out in West County in January and stopping close by for gas that I really started to think about stopping. And in my panic to not speed up my post collegiate swimming career weight gain, I held off on stopping in for far too long. That was until my temp position days were were coming to an end rather quickly and I thought I wouldn't be stopping at my trusty Mobil next door as often. Then lo and behold Stephen gets a full time job. Since then I have been in too many times to count.

The building must be a converted fast food restaurant that failed. They kept all the original seating and walls. Its, for use of a better word, ""tits""! Reminds me of the Hardees we used to frequent way too often, that is across the street from good ole St. Ambrose. Takes me back... So I'm going to go with its an old Hardees. They even use the drive thru. I'v only gone through twice. I enjoy watching my donut being taken out of the case and taking a seat among the reitrees (if time permits) too much.

The biggest reason they are awesome. I didn't realize the coconut one was going to be 80 cents as opposed to the 50 cents that most of them are (the menu board always has me confused, I can be rather slow). So when I walked in with my four quarters for two donuts. I was met with a surprise. And then the friendly donut server girl met me with another. She told me to pay her back next time I came in! I really hope that means I'm a regular! Well I'll be seeing her Tuesday after I fill up my gas tank. Better start thinking about what to get them for Xmas...

Donuts I've had so far (I'll update on what I try or remember on subsequent visits)

Glazed, best glazed I have ever had besides Dukes/Sunrise (Alton), it is best when it has been sitting for just a little while, not fresh out of the glaze, but not come to room temp yet. room temp is good too
Coconut on white cake with vanilla frosting - heaven!
Blueberry 
Chocolate long john

The food was amazingly delicious! I've always wanted to try a Jamaican patty, but have never found one that is vegan so I was thrilled to find they make some and theirs are wonderful! We also tried the curry chickpea patties and lentil soup and the flavors were perfect. We were short on time otherwise we would have tried the plate, but we will definitely be coming back numerous times. We took home the key lime cheesecake, blueberry muffins, carob muffins, and coconut cookie and they were all soooo delicious!!! Do yourself a favor and visit this sweet couple's kitchen.

We were waited on right away. The waitress didn't seem to know a lot about the menu. But she ran off to ask questions. 
I got the steak fajitas which were a very generous portion. My friend got a veggie quesadilla, also large portion. We both loved the food. Hot and fresh. Chips we're just ok. Guacamole was fresh/good . Salsa was too runny for our liking. Doesn't stay on the chip. 
The low score came from the end. They offered a discount for paying with cash, but instead ADDED it to our bill and also short changed us to boot.

The pastrami, pickled vegetables and truffle mustard were a perfect combination; I loved the Hamptons Sandwich. The bread also did not get soggy, huge plus!

The burrata on the caprese sandwich was to die for. The bread also remained crisp and the arugula added some bitterness to balance the luscious burrata.

The Nutella croissant was delicious but I personally could have done without the whipped cream (that didn't stop me from finishing all though).

There were only a few other people dining so there were plenty of seats.  I can imagine though this place being super packed on a Saturday.  

My go-to Mexican breakfasts are Chilaquiles or Chile Rellenos & Eggs.  Carlillos offers both.  So straight up Sophie's Choice. I found it super difficult to chose because I love both so much! I finally cut my limb and went with Chilaquiles.  I got it with chicken and green sauce. Husband got a chorizo and egg torta.  Which both came with rice, beans and pickled veggies.  All these components made up to one plated showpiece!  We watched our food being made and plated.  These guys behind the counter definitely know what they're doing.  It was like watching some kind of kitchen choreography.  

Both the chilaquiles and the torta were delicious! We were taken back by how much flavor each plate had! Portions were huge too! I only ate half of mine and took the other half to go.  My only complaint is that the rice was a little hard and under cooked.  Maybe an off day?

Lots of the flavors are magnificent versions of traditional flavors, and then there's the ones that you've never heard of before.  Like 'African Ground Nut Stew'.  Sounds offbeat, but its wonderful.

My parents, brother, and I on a Friday evening. We had reserved a month ahead of time and paid $65 a person. I thought that was a very reasonable price for the amount of food we received + it included gratuity! 

We started our meal with these delicious biscuits + butter. Wow they were so good. It was hard not to eat 4 of them. They were the best biscuits I've ever had!

We then had Corn Chowder with Kaffir Lime Cornbread and it was incredible. Very creamy and flavorful. Next we had cold beets with ricotta, amazing as well. We then had Potato & Mozzarella stuffed Cappellacci Carbonara. I think this was course, they were like pasta dumplings! So so good! The final savory course was Black Pepper Glazed Seitan with horseradish aioli & Apple/caramelized onion chutney. I didn't know Seitan could taste so good. Perfectly seasoned and paired well with the roasted carrots on the plate.

I visit Tucson for just under a month every year during the gem and mineral show, and this place is my go to. I visit these wonderful people almost every day for a fresh juice and usually grab at least one meal to eat on the spot and a second meal, wrap or veggie burger to snack on during the day. It's that good! You can tell that the owners put a lot of love and passion into their food! They never failed to deliver delicious and super healthy food to fuel me through the long days at gem show!  The entire staff are anyways helpful and happy!
